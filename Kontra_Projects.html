              <h3><strong>Scratch Game</strong></h3>
              <h5><strong>August 2018 - September 2018, Computer Science Principles</strong></h5>
                <p>The objective of this project was to program a game (or story, 
                but we chose game) that includes user interaction, meaning the user 
                has control over what happens in the game, and multiple states, or 
                levels, where the difficulty increases. Since this assignment was 
                a group project, my partner, Arvind and I split the work so that 
                we both worked on the code portion, but I worked more on designing 
                and building the levels, and he worked more on programming the 
                motion of the main sprite.</p>
                
                <p>This project taught me the importance 
                of communication. At first, we had some trouble with comminication. 
                It turned out we both had different views and plans for what the 
                final game would be like. However, after we focused on communication 
                and talked about what we both had in mind, we found a way of 
                incorporating each of our ideas into the game.</p>
                
                <p>Our game is not perfect, of course. It needs improvements and 
                more levels, but it was a good challenge and it taught us both an 
                important lesson. Our game, Flappity Flapper, is found to the right 
                for the client to try out with instructions found below. If you have 
                any ideas of features that you'd like to see in the game, feel 
                free to email me by clicking the email icon at the bottom of the 
                page. Feedback is greatly appreciated.</p>

                        <p>Click the green flag in the corner to start the game. Try to 
                        get to the green flag on the screen with the bird without touching 
                        the clouds. The bird can be controlled using the up, down, left, 
                        and right Arrow Keys. The game will restart the third level when 
                        the green flag is touched on Level 3, it's the end of the game.</p>

              <h3><strong>Image Manipulation with Python</strong></h3>
              <h5><strong>March 2018 - April 2018, Computer Science Principles</strong></h5>
                <p>The objective of this project was to create an algorithm 
                that modifies images according to the needs of the "client" 
                we have chosen out of the four clients we have been provided.
                The client my partner and I have chosen, Client #1, whom we pretended 
                was a club on our school's campus (Build Club), needed a logo for 
                an organization, company, etc. (in our case a club, of course). The logo we created is shown in the box to the right. </p>
                
                <p>This project taught me that programming isn't just about 
                writing code, but that it's also about the ability to 
                understand code of others and to modify it as needed. The 
                assignments leading up to this project each had new, and new 
                smaller algorithms that demonstrated different kinds of manipulations,
                which we were allowed to copy, and paste into our algorithm for this
                project. This required my partner and I to understand the programs
                in the assignments well enough to know which programs we needed 
                to use, and what we have to add, remove or change to suit the 
                goal of our algorithm, and requirements of the client.</p>
                
                <p>No matter which client we would have chosen, each required 
                a range of options for the final images. To meet this requirement, 
                we made it possible to put the logo anywhere on images by being 
                able to modify the given x- and y-coordinate for the positioning
                of the logo. In case the logo is hardly visible on images because
                of the color of the image it is pasted on, we also made a logo 
                that has a white background, so that this wouldn't be a problem.
                We also added a removable border, and removable dots on the 
                border, of which the client can also modify the color if they even
                want them to be present on their images. We used our algorithm 
                on actual images that have been taken of members of the Build 
                Club. These images can be viewed in the box to the right with 
                ranges of different outcomes of the algorithm.</p>
