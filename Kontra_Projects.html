              <h3><strong>Scratch Game</strong></h3>
              <h5><strong>August 2018 - September 2018, Computer Science Principles</strong></h5>
                <p>The objective of this project was to program a game (or story, 
                but we chose game) that includes user interaction, meaning the user 
                has control over what happens in the game, and multiple states, or 
                levels, where the difficulty increases. Since this assignment was 
                a group project, my partner, Arvind and I split the work so that 
                we both worked on the code portion, but I worked more on designing 
                and building the levels, and he worked more on programming the 
                motion of the main sprite.</p>
                
                <p>This project taught me the importance 
                of communication. At first, we had some trouble with comminication. 
                It turned out we both had different views and plans for what the 
                final game would be like. However, after we focused on communication 
                and talked about what we both had in mind, we found a way of 
                incorporating each of our ideas in the game.</p>
                
                <p>Our game is not perfect, of course. It needs improvements and 
                more levels, but it was a good challenge and it taught us both an 
                important lesson. Our game, Flappity Flapper, is found to the left 
                for you to try out with instructions found below. Feedback is 
                greatly appreciated.</p>

                        <p>Click the green flag in the corner to start the game. Try to 
                        get to the green flag on the screen with the bird without touching 
                        the clouds. The bird can be controlled using the up, down, left, 
                        and right Arrow Keys. The game will restart the third level when 
                        the green flag is touched on Level 3, it's the end of the game.</p> 
                        <p>Have fun playing!</p>
