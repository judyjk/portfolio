          <p>I am a Hungarian girl, who after being introduced to computer science 
            at a STEM camp for girls on the campus of Stanford University for a 
            week (called Tech Trek), decided to become a software engineer. 
            To make this dream a reality, I plan to join and attend 
            computer science related clubs and summer camps, as well as look for 
            internship programs when I am older. You probably think my goal is too 
            general for my age and for living near Silicon Valley, the hotspot 
            of computer science jobs and you are 
            probably right. My goal may be too general, however, around so many 
            talented people, it is challenging to be the best and since I like 
            challenges, I am working my hardest to succeed. During the one week 
            of Tech Trek, with my computer science class, we went on a fieldtrip 
            to Google Headquarters. At Google, first they showed us around in the 
            building we spent the rest of the day, then they let us try Virtual 
            Reality Headsets, and a 3D drawing software for VR, called Tilt Brush. 
            My goal is to work at Google in the future because I admire the working 
            environment, and I also love the softwares they develop, which I 
            would like to be a part of.</p>
          <p>In seventh and eighth grade, I was part of the school's leadership 
            class. There were a lot of events we had to plan and activities we 
            had to come up with and plan throughout each year. Sometimes, things 
            were not going as planned, such as when we did not get enough money 
            out of a fundraiser. However, we learned to be ambitious and come up 
            with ideas during reflection time to make the next fundraiser better. 
            In the leadership class, we were also always divided into committees, 
            or groups, so we were never working on an event alone. Therefore, I 
            learned to cooperate well with others.</p>
          <p>An mportant achievement I am very proud of is being selected to be one of the 
            eighty girls who could attend Tech Trek out of California. From Tech 
            Trek, I learned some of the basics of MIT App Inventor (and a lot 
            more not-computer-science related things). I also applied and got 
            accepted into the middle school leadership class. From being part of the 
            leadership class, I learned how to work well with people as a team, 
            public speaking, how to plan and organize an event and the qualities 
            of a good leader. Other achievements of mine are that my overall GPA
            from middle school was a 3.98, and that at 
            the end of eighth grade, I earned an Outstanding Student Award. An 
            activity I currently participate in is a club called Girls Exploring 
            Technology, Science, and Engineering Together (GET SET) where we 
            have a ton of field trip opportunities to sign up for to go to STEM 
            related companies to get to know what they do, what kind of jobs 
            there are, and what each job title is in charge of doing
            So far from GET SET, I went to SAP, Clorox, and NVIDIA, which taught
            me a lot of interesting things about the technology they use or create.
            I had no idea what each of the companies do (other than Clorox making 
            cleaning products, which it's not really just about that), so it was 
            very interesting to learn not just about their technology, but about
            the company itself.</p>
          <p>In conclusion, I am working hard on and aspiring to achieve my goal 
          of becoming a software engineer by developing my computer 
          science related skills, like logic, programming, and working with others.
